<h1>Intro to Python Exercises ✍ </h1>

<p>This repository contains a collection of exercises for learning and practicing Python programming language fundamentals. These exercises cover various topics, including variables, data types, control flow, loops, functions, and more.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used 🛠️ </h2>

<p>The exercises are implemented using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python 🐍</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description 📝</h2>

<p>This project is a compilation of exercises aimed at beginners who are learning Python. The exercises are designed to provide hands-on practice and reinforce the concepts covered in Python programming.</p>

<p>The exercises cover a wide range of topics and progressively increase in complexity to challenge learners and improve their understanding of Python programming concepts.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites 📋 </h2>

<p>Before you begin, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python Downloads</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation 🔧 </h2>

<p>To access the exercises, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:</li>

  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/BrunoSouza88/exercise-intro-to-python.git</code></pre>

  <li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>

  <pre><code>cd exercise-intro-to-python</code></pre>
</ol>

<h2>Usage 💡 </h2>

<p>The exercises are organized into different directories based on the topics they cover. Each exercise is provided as a separate Python file.</p>

<p>To practice a specific exercise, open the corresponding Python file in your preferred editor or IDE and run it using the Python interpreter. Read the exercise instructions and write your solution in the designated area provided within the file.</p>

<p>You can also use the exercises to create your own Python programs and expand upon them to further practice and explore Python programming concepts.</p>
